# Type Alias: supergroup

> **supergroup**: `object`

Represents a supergroup or channel with zero or more members (subscribers in the case of channels). From the point of view of the system, a channel is a special kind of a supergroup:

- only administrators can post and see the list of members, and posts from all administrators use the name and photo of the channel instead of individual names and profile photos.

- Unlike supergroups, channels can have an unlimited number of subscribers
