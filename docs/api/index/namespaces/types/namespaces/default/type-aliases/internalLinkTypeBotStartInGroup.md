# Type Alias: internalLinkTypeBotStartInGroup

> **internalLinkTypeBotStartInGroup**: `object`

The link is a link to a Telegram bot, which is supposed to be added to a group chat. Call searchPublicChat with the given bot username, check that the user is a bot and can be added to groups,

- ask the current user to select a basic group or a supergroup chat to add the bot to, taking into account that bots can be added to a public supergroup only by administrators of the supergroup.

- If administrator rights are provided by the link, call getChatMember to receive the current bot rights in the chat and if the bot already is an administrator,

- check that the current user can edit its administrator rights, combine received rights with the requested administrator rights, show confirmation box to the user,

- and call setChatMemberStatus with the chosen chat and confirmed administrator rights. Before call to setChatMemberStatus it may be required to upgrade the chosen basic group chat to a supergroup chat.

- Then, if start_parameter isn't empty, call sendBotStartMessage with the given start parameter and the chosen chat; otherwise, just send /start message with bot's username added to the chat
