- If downloadFile/addFileToDownloads is called on such a file or if it is sent to a secret chat, TDLib starts a file generation process by sending updateFileGenerationStart to the application with the HTTP URL in the original_path and "#url#" as the conversion string.

- Application must generate the file by downloading it to the specified location
